                    <p >Eliot embraces all genres of music. As a result, he is in demand as a bassist not only in jazz but also gospel, R&B, rock, pop, go-go and world music. Eliot was the house bassist for the Bohemian Caverns Jazz Orchestra from 2010-2014 (voted Best Large Ensemble in DC by the Washington City Paper in 2011, 2012, 2013).

Being in D.C. has also afforded Eliot the opportunity to perform at universities, museums, churches, embassies and the U.S. Capitol, in addition to the White House. Exposure to the new school, the old school and everything in between has developed Eliot’s unique voice as a bass player and also as a composer and a bandleader.

Eliot shares his passion for music by teaching private lessons in electric bass, upright bass and jazz theory/improv.
